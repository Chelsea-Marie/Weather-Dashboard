# Weather-Dashboard

The Weather Dashboard allows visitors to search for both current weather conditions and the 5 day forecast for any city by making calls to the "Open Weather Map" API. It also stores their search history in local storage and displays as buttons underneath the search bar for the visitor to go back and view previous searches in that same session.
